# Me
Hello, I'm Aaron Menzel – a system engineer in the field of unified endpoint management with a passion for IT infrastructure from the most beautiful state in Germany, Saarland.

Since completing my computer science degree, I have been surviving in the IT world for 10 years, including 8 years at SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH in Wiesbaden. My daily business? Pure Unified Endpoint Management: Microsoft Intune is my turf, supplemented by general topics such as Windows, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, Android Enterprise, Microsoft PKI, Entra ID, and Conditional Access. Whether it's policy deployment, certificate authentication, or VPN troubleshooting, I optimize endpoints to keep everything running smoothly.

# Skills
- Microsoft Intune (all of it).
- Platform management: iOS/iPadOS, macOS, Android Enterprise, Windows.
- Security: Microsoft PKI, Entra ID, Conditional Access.

In my free time, I recharge my batteries with mountain bike and gravel bike tours in nature, play video games, or pump iron at the gym—perfect for clearing my head.
